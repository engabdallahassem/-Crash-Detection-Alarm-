# Crash-Detection-with location and personal information alarm 
A majority of car crash is affected by careless driving that causes extensive economic and social costs, as well as
injuries and fatalities. Thus, the research of precise crash detection systems is very significant issues in automotive
safety. A lot of crash detection algorithms have been developed, but the coverage of these algorithms has been limited
to few scenarios. Road scenes and situations need to be considered in order to expand the scope of a collision
detection system to include a variety of collision modes. The proposed algorithm effectively handles the x, y, and z
axes of the sensor, while considering time and suggests a method suitable for various real worlds. To reduce nuisance
and false crash detection events, the algorithm discriminated between driving mode and parking mode. The
performance of the suggested algorithm was evaluated under various scenarios, and it successfully discriminated
between driving and parking modes, and it adjusted crash detection events depending on the real scenario. The
proposed algorithm is expected to efficiently manage the space and lifespan of the storage device by allowing the
vehicle's black box system to store only necessary crash eventâ€™s videos.
